<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The fearefull aboundinge
at this time in this countrie,
of these detestable slaues of
the Deuill, the Witches or
enchaunters, hath moved
me (beloued reader) to dispatch
in post, this following
treatise of mine, not in
any wise (as I protest) to
serue for a shew of my learning &amp; ingine, but
onely (mooued of conscience) to preasse thereby,
so farre as I can, to resolue the doubting harts of
many; both that such assaultes of Sathan are
most certainly practized, &amp; that the instrumentes
thereof, merits most severly to be punished:
against the damnable opinions of two
principally in our age, wherof the one called
SCOT an  Englishman, is not ashamed in
publike print to deny, that ther can be such a
thing as Witch-craft: and so mainteines the old
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
error of the Sadducees, in denying of spirits. The
other called VVIERVS, a German Phisition,
sets out a publick apologie for al these craftes-folkes,
whereby, procuring for their impunitie, he
plainely bewrayes himselfe to haue bene one of
that profession. And for to make this treatise the
more pleasaunt and facill, I haue put it in forme
of a Dialogue, which I haue diuided into three
bookes: The first speaking of Magie in general,
and Necromancie in special. The second of
Sorcerie and Witch-craft: and the thirde, conteines
a discourse of all these kindes of spirits, &amp;
Spectres that appeares &amp; trobles persones:
together with a conclusion of the whol work. My
intention in this labour, is only to proue two
things, as I haue alreadie said: the one, that
such diuelish artes haue bene and are. The
other, what exact trial and seuere punishment
they merite: &amp; therefore reason I, what kinde
of things are possible to be performed in these
arts, &amp; by what naturall causes they may be, not
that I touch every particular thing of the Deuils
power, for that were infinite: but onelie, to
speak scholasticklie, (since this can not bee spoken
in our language) I reason vpon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span> leauing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id="Pgxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
species, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">and differentia</span></span>
to be comprehended therein. As for example, speaking of the power
of Magiciens, in the first book &amp; sixt Chapter:
I say, that they can suddenly cause be brought
vnto them, all kindes of daintie disshes, by their
familiar spirit: Since as a thiefe he delightes to
steale, and as a spirite, he can subtillie &amp; suddenlie
inough transport the same. Now vnder
this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">genus</span></span> may be comprehended al particulars,
depending thereupon; Such as the bringing Wine
out of a Wall, (as we haue heard oft to haue
bene practised] and such others; which particulars,
are sufficientlie proved by the reasons of
the general. And such like in the second booke of
Witch-craft in speciall, and fift Chap. I say and
proue by diuerse arguments, that Witches can,
by the power of their Master, cure or cast on
disseases: Now by these same reasones, that
proues their power by the Deuil of disseases in
generally is aswell proued their power in speciall:
as of weakening the nature of some men, to make
them vnable for women: and making it to abound
in others, more then the ordinary course of nature
would permit. And such like in all other particular
sicknesses; But one thing I will pray thee
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to obserue in all these places, where I reason
upon the deuils power, which is the different
ends &amp; scopes, that God as the first cause, and
the Devill as his instrument and second cause
shootes at in all these actiones of the Deuil, (as
Gods hang-man:) For where the deuilles intention
in them is euer to perish, either the soule or
the body, or both of them, that he is so permitted
to deale with: God by the contrarie, drawes euer
out of that euill glorie to himselfe, either by
the wracke of the wicked in his justice, or by
the tryall of the patient, and amendment of the
faithfull, being wakened vp with that rod of
correction. Hauing thus declared vnto thee then,
my full intention in this Treatise, thou wilt
easelie excuse, I doubt not, aswel my pretermitting,
to declare the whole particular rites and
secretes of these vnlawfull artes: as also their
infinite and wounderfull practises, as being
neither of them pertinent to my purpose: the
reason whereof, is giuen in the hinder ende of the
first Chapter of the thirde booke: and who likes
to be curious in these thinges, he may reade, if he
will here of their practises, BODINVS Dæmonomanie,
collected with greater diligence,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexv">[pg xv]</span><a name="Pgxv" id="Pgxv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
then written with judgement, together with their
confessions, that haue bene at this time apprehened.
If he would know what hath bene the
opinion of the Auncientes, concerning their
power: he shall see it wel described by HYPERIVS,
&amp; HEMMINGIVS, two late
Germaine writers: Besides innumerable other
neoterick Theologues, that writes largelie vpon
that subject: And if he woulde knowe what are
the particuler rites, &amp; curiosities of these black
arts (which is both vnnecessarie and perilous,)
he will finde it in the fourth book of CORNELIVS
Agrippa, and in VVIERVS, whomof
I spak. And so wishing my pains in this
Treatise (beloued Reader} to be effectual, in
arming al them that reades the same, against
these aboue mentioned erroures, and recommending
my good will to thy friendly acceptation,
I bid thee hartely fare-well.

Prophane and against all Theologie: the Diuell in

Neither could that bring any inconvenient

of God speakes nothing in vaine, nether doth it lay
curses, or injoyne punishmentes vpon shaddowes,
condemning that to be il, which is not in essence or

wicked <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pharaohs</span></span> wise-men imitated ane number

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epi.</span></span> I thinke ye take me to be a Witch my selfe,
or at the least would faine sweare your selfe prentise
to that craft: Alwaies as I may, I shall shortlie
satisfie you, in that kinde of conjurations, which
are conteined in such bookes, which I call the Deuilles
Schoole: There are foure principall partes;
the persons of the conjurers; the action of the conjuration;
the wordes and rites vsed to that effect;
and the Spirites that are conjured. Ye must first remember
to laye the ground, that I tould you before:
which is, that it is no power inherent in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
circles, or in the holines of the names of God blasphemouslie
vsed: nor in whatsoeuer rites or ceremonies
at that time vsed, that either can raise any
infernall spirit, or yet limitat him perforce within
or without these circles. For it is he onelie, the father
of all lyes, who hauing first of all prescribed
that forme of doing, feining himselfe to be commanded
&amp; restreined thereby, wil be loath to passe
the boundes of these injunctiones; aswell thereby
to make them glory in the impiring ouer him (as I
saide before:) As likewise to make himselfe so to
be trusted in these little thinges, that he may haue
the better commoditie thereafter, to deceiue them
in the end with a tricke once for all; I meane the euerlasting
perdition of their soul &amp; body. Then laying
this ground, as I haue said, these conjurationes
must haue few or mo in number of the persones
conjurers (alwaies passing the singuler number) according
to the qualitie of the circle, and forme of
apparition. Two principall thinges cannot well in
that errand be wanted: holie-water (whereby the
Deuill mockes the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papistes</span></span>) and some present of a
liuing thing vnto him. There ar likewise certaine
seasons, dayes and houres, that they obserue in this
purpose: These things being all readie, and prepared,
circles are made triangular, quadrangular,
round, double or single, according to the forme of
apparition that they craue. But to speake of the diuerse
formes of the circles, of the innumerable
characters and crosses that are within and without,
and out-through the same, of the diuers formes of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apparitiones, that that craftie spirit illudes them
with, and or all such particulars in that action, I remit
it to ouer-manie that haue busied their heades
in describing of the same; as being but curious, and
altogether vnprofitable. And this farre onelie I
touch, that when the conjured Spirit appeares,
which will not be while after manie circumstances,
long praiers, and much muttring and murmuring
of the conjurers; like a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papist</span></span> priest, dispatching
a hunting <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Masse</span></span>: how sone I say, he appeares, if they
haue missed one iote of all their rites; or if any of
their feete once slyd ouer the circle through terror
of his feareful apparition, he payes himselfe at that
time in his owne hande, of that due debt which
they ought him; and other-wise would haue delayed
longer to haue payed him: I meane hee
carries them with him bodie and soule. If this be
not now a just cause to make them wearie of these
formes of conjuration, I leaue it to you to judge
vpon; considering the long-somenesse of the labour,
the precise keeping of dayes and houres (as I
haue said), the terriblenesse of apparition, and the
present perrell that they stande in, in missing the
least circumstance or freite, that they ought to obserue:
And on the other parte, the Deuil is glad to
mooue them to a plaine and square dealing with
him as I said before.

who is doubtleslie learned, inough in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Physiognomie</span></span>:
Yea, he will make his schollers to creepe in
credite with Princes, by fore-telling them manie
greate thinges; parte true, parte false: For if all
were false, he would tyne credite at all handes; but
alwaies doubtsome, as his Oracles were. And he
will also make them to please Princes, by faire banquets
and daintie dishes, carryed in short space fra
the farthest part of the worlde. For no man doubts
but he is a thiefe, and his agilitie (as I spake before)
makes him to come suche speede. Such-like, he
will guard his schollers with faire armies of horse-men
and foote-men in appearance, castles and
fortes: Which all are but impressiones in the aire,
easelie gathered by a spirite, drawing so neare to
that substance himselfe: As in like maner he will
learne them manie juglarie trickes at Gardes, dice,
&amp; such like, to deceiue mennes senses thereby: and
such innumerable false practicques; which are prouen
by ouer-manie in this age: As they who ar acquainted
with that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Italian</span></span> called
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Scoto</span></span> yet liuing,
can reporte. And yet are all these thinges but deluding
of the senses, and no waies true in substance,
as were the false miracles wrought by King <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pharaoes</span></span>
Magicians, for counterfeiting <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moyses</span></span>: For that
is the difference betuixt Gods myracles and the
Deuils, God is a creator, what he makes appeare
in miracle, it is so in effect. As <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moyses</span></span> rod being casten
downe, was no doubt turned in a natural Serpent:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
where as the Deuill (as Gods Ape) counterfetting
that by his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magicians</span></span>, maid their wandes to
appeare so, onelie to mennes outward senses: as kythed
in effect by their being deuoured by the other.
For it is no wonder, that the Deuill may delude
our senses, since we see by common proofe,
that simple juglars will make an hundreth thinges
seeme both to our eies and eares otherwaies then
they are. Now as to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magicians</span></span> parte of the contract,
it is in a word that thing, which I said before,

common Prouerb (that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Necromancers</span></span> commands
the Deuill, which ye haue already refuted). The one
is grounded vpon a receiued custome: The other
vpon an authoritie, which some thinkes infallible.
Vpon custome, we see that diuerse Christian Princes
and Magistrates seuere punishers of Witches,
will not onelie ouer-see <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magicians</span></span> to liue within

expreslie said in the Scriptures) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in all the sciences of

the principalles. And he notwithstanding of this

</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epi.</span></span> As to the first of your reasones, grounded
vpon custome: I saie, an euill custome can neuer
be accepted for a good law, for the ouer great ignorance
of the worde in some Princes and Magistrates,
and the contempt thereof in others, moues
them to sinne heavelie against their office in that
poynt. As to the other reasone, which seemes to be
of greater weight, if it were formed in a Syllogisme;
it behooued to be in manie termes, and full
of fallacies (to speake in termes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Logicque</span></span>) for first,
that that generall proposition; affirming <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moyses</span></span>
to be taught <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in all the sciences of the Ægyptians</span></span>,
should conclude that he was taught in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magie</span></span>, I see
no necessity. For we must vnderstand that the spirit
of God there, speaking of sciences, vnderstandes
them that are lawfull; for except they be lawfull,
they are but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">abusiuè</span></span> called sciences, &amp; are but ignorances
indeede: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Nam homo pictus, non est homo</span></span>. Secondlie,
giuing that he had bene taught in it, there
is great difference, betwixt knowledge and practising
of a thing (as I said before). For God knoweth
all thinges, being alwaies good, and of our sinne
&amp; our infirmitie proceedeth our ignorance. Thirdlie,
giuing that he had both studied and practised
the same (which is more nor monstruous to be beleeued
by any Christian) yet we know well inough,
that before that euer the spirite of God began
to call <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moyses</span></span>, he was fled out of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ægypt</span></span>, being fourtie yeares of age, for the slaughter of an
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ægyptian</span></span>, and in his good-father
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iethroes</span></span> lande,
first called at the firie bushe, hauing remained there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other fourtie yeares in exile: so that suppose he had
beene the wickeddest man in the worlde before, he
then became a changed and regenerat man, and very
litle of olde <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moyses</span></span> remained in him.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Abraham</span></span>
was an Idolater in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vr</span></span> of

And <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Paule</span></span> being called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saule</span></span>,
was a most sharp
persecutor of the Saintes of God, while that name

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phi.</span></span> But I pray you before ye goe further, let
mee interrupt you here with a shorte digression:
which is, that manie can scarcely beleeue that there
is such a thing as Witch-craft. Whose reasons I wil
shortely alleage vnto you, that ye may satisfie me as
well in that, as ye haue done in the rest. For first,
whereas the Scripture seemes to prooue Witchcraft
to be, by diuerse examples, and speciallie by
sundrie of the same, which ye haue alleaged, it is
thought by some, that these places speakes of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magicians</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Necromancers</span></span> onlie, &amp; not of Witches.
As in special, these wise men of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pharaohs</span></span>, that counterfeited
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Moyses</span></span> miracles, were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magicians</span></span> say they,
&amp; not Witches: As likewise that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pythonisse</span></span> that
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saul</span></span> consulted with: And so was
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Simon Magus</span></span> in the
new Testament, as that very stile importes. Secondlie,
where ye would oppone the dailie practicque,
&amp; confession of so manie, that is thought likewise to
be but verie melancholicque imaginations of simple
rauing creatures. Thirdly, if Witches had such
power of Witching of folkes to death, (as they say
they haue) there had bene none left aliue long
sence in the world, but they: at the least, no good
or godlie person of whatsoeuer estate, coulde
haue escaped their deuilrie.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epi.</span></span> Your three reasons as I take, ar grounded
the first of them <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">negativè</span></span> vpon the Scripture: The
second <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">affirmativè</span></span> vpon Physicke: And the thirde
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vpon the certaine proofe of experience. As to your
first, it is most true indeede, that all these wise men
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pharaoh</span></span> were <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magicians</span></span> of art:
As likewise it appeares wel that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pythonisse</span></span>,
with whom <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Saul</span></span> consulted,
was of that same profession: &amp; so was <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Simon
Magus</span></span>. But yee omitted to speake of the Lawe of
God, wherein are all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magicians</span></span>, Diuines, Enchanters,
Sorcerers, Witches, &amp; whatsouer of that kinde
that consultes with the Deuill, plainelie prohibited,
and alike threatned against. And besides that,
she who had the Spirite of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Python</span></span>, in the Actes,
</p><div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 80%; font-style: italic">Act.</span></span><span style="font-size: 80%"> 16.</span></div></div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
whose Spirite was put to silence by the Apostle,
coulde be no other thing but a verie Sorcerer or
Witch, if ye admit the vulgare distinction, to be
in a maner true, whereof I spake in the beginning
of our conference. For that spirit whereby she conquested
such gaine to her Master, was not at her
raising or commanding, as she pleased to appoynt,
but spake by her toung, aswel publicklie, as priuatelie:
Whereby she seemed to draw nearer to the sort
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Demoniakes</span></span> or possessed, if that conjunction betwixt
them, had not bene of her owne consent:
as it appeared by her, not being tormented therewith:
And by her conquesting of such gaine to her
masters (as I haue alreadie said.) As to your second
reason grounded vpon Physick, in attributing their
confessiones or apprehensiones, to a naturall melancholicque
humour: Anie that pleases Physicallie
to consider vpon the naturall humour of melancholie,
according to all the Physicians, that euer
writ thereupon, they shall finde that that will be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ouer short a cloak to couer their knauery with: For
as the humor of Melancholie in the selfe is blacke,
heauie and terrene, so are the symptomes thereof,
in any persones that are subject therevnto, leannes,
palenes, desire of solitude: and if they come to the
highest degree therof, mere folie and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Manie</span></span>: where
as by the contrarie, a great nomber of them that euer
haue bene convict or confessors of Witchcraft,
as may be presently seene by manie that haue at
this time confessed: they are by the contrarie, I say,
some of them rich and worldly-wise, some of them
fatte or corpulent in their bodies, and most part of
them altogether giuen ouer to the pleasures of the
flesh, continual haunting of companie, and all kind
of merrines, both lawfull and vnlawfull, which are
thinges directly contrary to the symptomes of Melancholie,
whereof I spake, and further experience
daylie proues how loath they are to confesse without
torture, which witnesseth their guiltines, where
by the contrary, the Melancholicques neuer spares
to bewray themselues, by their continuall discourses,
feeding therby their humor in that which they
thinke no crime. As to your third reason, it scarselie
merites an answere. For if the deuill their master
were not bridled, as the scriptures teacheth vs, suppose
there were no men nor women to be his instrumentes,
he could finde waies inough without
anie helpe of others to wrack al mankinde: wherevnto
he employes his whole study, and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">goeth about
like a roaring Lyon</span></span> (as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Peter</span></span> saith)

to that effect, but

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

not power in the least jote to transgresse. But beside
all this, there is ouer greate a certainty to proue
that they are, by the daily experience of the harmes
that they do, both to men, and whatsoeuer thing
men possesses, whome God will permit them to be
the instrumentes, so to trouble or visite, as in my
discourse of that arte, yee shall heare clearelie proued.

riche and of better accompt, poore and of basser
degree. These two degrees now of persones, that
practises this craft, answers to the passions in them,
which (I told you before) the Deuil vsed as meanes
to intyse them to his seruice, for such of them as are
in great miserie and pouertie, he allures to follow
him, by promising vnto them greate riches, and
worldlie commoditie. Such as though riche, yet
burnes in a desperat desire of reuenge, hee allures
them by promises, to get their turne satisfied to
their hartes contentment. It is to be noted nowe,
that that olde and craftie enemie of ours, assailes
none, though touched with any of these two extremities,
except he first finde an entresse reddy for
him, either by the great ignorance of the person he
deales with, ioyned with an euill life, or else by
their carelesnes and contempt of God: And finding
them in an vtter despair, for one of these two
former causes that I haue spoken of; he prepares
the way by feeding them craftely in their humour,
and filling them further and further with despaire,
while he finde the time proper to discouer himself
vnto them. At which time, either vpon their walking
solitarie in the fieldes, or else lying pansing in
their bed; but alwaies without the company of any
other, he either by a voyce, or in likenesse of a man
inquires of them, what troubles them: and promiseth
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them, a suddaine and certaine waie of remedie,
vpon condition on the other parte, that they
follow his advise; and do such thinges as he wil require
of them: Their mindes being prepared before
hand, as I haue alreadie spoken, they easelie
agreed vnto that demande of his: And syne settes
an other tryist, where they may meete againe. At
which time, before he proceede any further with
them, he first perswades them to addict themselues
to his seruice: which being easely obteined, he then
discouers what he is vnto them: makes them to renunce
their God and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Baptisme</span></span> directlie, and giues
them his marke vpon some secreit place of their
bodie, which remaines soare vnhealed, while his
next meeting with them, and thereafter euer insensible,
how soeuer it be nipped or pricked by any,
as is dailie proued, to giue them a proofe thereby,
that as in that doing, hee could hurte and heale
them; so all their ill and well doing thereafter, must
depende vpon him. And besides that, the intollerable
dolour that they feele in that place, where he
hath marked them, serues to waken them, and not
to let them rest, while their next meeting againe:
fearing least otherwaies they might either forget
him, being as new Prentises, and not well inough
founded yet, in that fiendlie follie: or else remembring
of that horrible promise they made him, at
their last meeting, they might skunner at the same,
and preasse to call it back. At their thirde meeting,
he makes a shew to be carefull to performe his promises,
either by teaching them waies howe to get
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
themselues reuenged, if they be of that sort: Or els
by teaching them lessons, how by moste vilde and
vnlawfull meanes, they may obtaine gaine, and
worldlie commoditie, if they be of the other sorte.

Ye haue said now inough of their initiating in
that ordour. It restes then that ye discourse vpon
their practises, fra they be passed Prentises: for
I would faine heare what is possible to them to
performe in verie deede. Although they serue a
common Master with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Necromancers</span></span>, (as I haue
before saide) yet serue they him in an other forme.
For as the meanes are diuerse, which allures them
to these vnlawfull artes of seruing of the Deuill; so
by diuerse waies vse they their practises, answering
to these meanes, which first the Deuill, vsed as instrumentes
in them; though al tending to one end:
To wit, the enlargeing of Sathans tyrannie, and
crossing of the propagation of the Kingdome of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span>, so farre as lyeth in the possibilitie, either
of the one or other sorte, or of the Deuill their Master.
For where the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magicians</span></span>, as allured by curiositie,
in the most parte of their practises, seekes principallie
the satisfying of the same, and to winne to
themselues a popular honoure and estimation:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
These Witches on the other parte, being intised
ether for the desire of reuenge, or of worldly riches,
their whole practises are either to hurte men and
their gudes, or what they possesse, for satisfying of
their cruell mindes in the former, or else by the
wracke in whatsoeuer sorte, of anie whome God
will permitte them to haue power off, to satisfie
their greedie desire in the last poynt.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epi.</span></span> In two partes their actiones may be diuided;
the actiones of their owne persones, and the
actiones proceeding from them towardes anie other.
And this diuision being wel vnderstood, will
easilie resolue you, what is possible to them to doe.
For although all that they confesse is no lie vpon
their parte, yet doubtlesly in my opinion, a part of
it is not indeede, according as they take it to be:
And in this I meane by the actiones of their owne
persones. For as I said before, speaking of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magie</span></span>
that the Deuill illudes the senses of these schollers
of his, in manie thinges, so saye I the like of these
Witches.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epi.</span></span> To the effect that they may performe such
seruices of their false Master, as he employes them
in, the deuill as Gods Ape, counterfeites in his seruantes
this seruice &amp; forme of adoration, that God
prescribed and made his seruantes to practise. For
as the seruants of GOD, publicklie vses to conveene
for seruing of him, so makes he them in great
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
numbers to conveene (though publickly they dare
not) for his seruice. As none conueenes to the adoration
and worshipping of God, except they be
marked with his scale, the Sacrament of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Baptisme</span></span>:
So none serues Sathan, and conueenes to the adoring
of him, that are not marked with that marke,
wherof I alredy spake. As the Minister sent by God,
teacheth plainely at the time of their publick conuentions,
how to serue him in spirit &amp; truth: so that
vncleane spirite, in his owne person teacheth his
Disciples, at the time of their conueening, how to
worke all kinde of mischiefe: And craues compt
of all their horrible and detestable proceedinges
passed, for aduancement of his seruice. Yea, that he
may the more viuelie counterfeit and scorne God,
he oft times makes his slaues to conveene in these
verrie places, which are destinat and ordeined for
the conveening of the servantes of God (I meane
by Churches). But this farre, which I haue yet said,
I not onelie take it to be true in their opiniones,
but euen so to be indeede. For the forme that he
vsed in counterfeiting God amongst the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gentiles</span></span>,
makes me so to thinke: As God spake by his Oracles,
spake he not so by his? As GOD had aswell
bloudie Sacrifices, as others without bloud, had
not he the like? As God had Churches sanctified
to his seruice, with Altars, Priests, Sacrifices, Ceremonies
and Prayers; had he not the like polluted
to his seruice? As God gaue responses by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Vrim</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Thummim</span></span>, gaue he not his responses by the intralls
of beastes, by the singing of Fowles, and by their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
actiones in the aire? As God by visiones, dreames,
and extases reueiled what was to come, and what
was his will vnto his seruantes; vsed he not the like
meanes to forwarne his slaues of things to come?
Yea, euen as God loued cleannes, hated vice, and
impuritie, &amp; appoynted punishmentes therefore:
vsed he not the like (though falselie I grant, and but
in eschewing the lesse inconuenient, to draw them
upon a greater) yet dissimuled he not I say, so farre
as to appoynt his Priestes to keepe their bodies
cleane and vndefiled, before their asking responses
of him? And feyned he not God to be a protectour
of euerie vertue, and a iust reuenger of the
contrarie? This reason then moues me, that as he
is that same Deuill; and as craftie nowe as he was
then; so wil hee not spare a pertelie in these actiones
that I haue spoken of, concerning the witches
persones: But further, Witches oft times confesses
not only his conueening in the Church with them,
but his occupying of the Pulpit: Yea, their forme
of adoration, to be the kissing of his hinder partes.
Which though it seeme ridiculous, yet may it likewise
be true, seeing we reade that in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Calicute</span></span>, he appearing
in forme of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Goate</span></span>-bucke, hath publicklie
that vn-honest homage done vnto him, by euerie
one of the people: So ambitious is he, and greedie
of honour (which procured his fall) that he will
euen imitate God in that parte,

to be deluded in, and though they lye not in
confessing of it, because they thinke it to be true,
yet not to be so in substance or effect: for they saie,
that by diuerse meanes they may conueene, either
to the adoring of their Master, or to the putting in
practise any seruice of his, committed vnto their
charge: one way is natural, which is natural riding,
going or sayling, at what houre their Master comes
and aduertises them. And this way may be easelie
beleued: an other way is some-what more strange:
and yet is it possible to be true: which is by being
carryed by the force of the Spirite which is their
conducter, either aboue the earth or aboue the Sea
swiftlie, to the place where they are to meet: which
I am perswaded to be likewaies possible, in respect
that as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Habakkuk</span></span> was carryed by the Angell in that
forme, to the denne where <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Daniell</span></span> laie;

so thinke I,
the Deuill will be reddie to imitate God, as well in
that as in other thinges: which is much more possible
to him to doe, being a Spirite, then to a mighty
winde, being but a naturall meteore, to transporte
from one place to an other a solide bodie, as is commonlie
and dailie seene in practise: But in this violent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
forme they cannot be carryed, but a shorte
boundes, agreeing with the space that they may reteine
their breath: for if it were longer, their breath
could not remaine vnextinguished, their bodie being
carryed in such a violent &amp; forceable maner, as
be example: If one fall off an small height, his life is
but in perrell, according to the harde or soft lighting:
But if one fall from an high and stay rocke, his
breath wilbe forceablie banished from the bodie,
before he can win to the earth, as is oft seen by experience.
And in this transporting they say themselues,
that they are inuisible to anie other, except
amongst themselues; which may also be possible in
my opinion. For if the deuil may forme what kinde
of impressiones he pleases in the aire, as I haue said
before, speaking of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Magie</span></span>, why may he not far easilier
thicken &amp; obscure so the air, that is next about
them by contracting it strait together, that the
beames of any other mans eyes, cannot pearce
thorow the same, to see them? But the third way of
their comming to their conuentions, is, that where
in I think them deluded: for some of them sayeth,
that being transformed in the likenesse of a little
beast or foule, they will come and pearce through
whatsoeuer house or Church, though all ordinarie
passages be closed, by whatsoeuer open, the aire
may enter in at. And some sayeth, that their bodies
lying stil as in an extasy, their spirits wil be rauished
out of their bodies, &amp; caried to such places. And for
verefying therof, wil giue euident tokens, aswel by
witnesses that haue seene their body lying senseles
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the meane time, as by naming persones, whom-with
they mette, and giuing tokens what purpose
was amongst them, whome otherwaies they could
not haue knowen: for this forme of journeing, they
affirme to vse most, when they are transported
from one Countrie to another.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phi.</span></span> Surelie I long to heare your owne opinion
of this: For they are like old wiues trattles about
the fire. The reasons that moues me to thinke that
these are meere illusiones, ar these. First for them
that are transformed in likenes of beastes or foules,
can enter through so narrow passages, although I
may easelie beleeue that the Deuill coulde by his
woorkemanshippe vpon the aire, make them appeare
to be in such formes, either to themselues or
to others: Yet how he can contract a solide bodie
within so little roome, I thinke it is directlie contrarie
to it selfe, for to be made so little, and yet not
diminished: To be so straitlie drawen together,
and yet feele no paine; I thinke it is so contrarie to
the qualitie of a naturall bodie, and so like to the
little transubstantiat god in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papistes Masse</span></span>,
that I can neuer beleeue it. So to haue a quantitie, is
so proper to a solide bodie, that as all Philosophers
conclude, it cannot be any more without one,
then a spirite can haue one. For when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Peter</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">came out of the prison,
</span></span></p><div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 80%; font-style: italic">Act. 12.</span></span></div></div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">
and the doores all locked</span></span>: It was not by
any contracting of his bodie in so little roome: but
by the giuing place of the dore, though vn-espyed
by the Gaylors. And yet is there no comparison,
when this is done, betuixt the power of God, and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the Deuill. As to their forme of extasie and spirituall
transporting, it is certaine the soules going
out of the bodie, is the onely difinition of naturall
death: and who are once dead, God forbid wee
should thinke that it should lie in the power of all
the Deuils in Hell, to restore them to their life againe:
Although he can put his owne spirite in a
dead bodie, which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Necromancers</span></span> commonlie
practise, as yee haue harde. For that is the office
properly belonging to God; and besides that, the
soule once parting from the bodie, cannot wander
anie longer in the worlde, but to the owne resting
place must it goe immediatlie, abiding the
conjunction of the bodie againe, at the latter daie.
And what <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> or the Prophets did miraculouslie
in this case, it cannot in no Christian mans
opinion be maid common with the Deuill. As for
anie tokens that they giue for proouing of this, it
is verie possible to the Deuils craft, to perswade
them to these meanes. For he being a spirite, may
hee not so rauishe their thoughtes, and dull their
sences, that their bodie lying as dead, hee may object
to their spirites as it were in a dreame, &amp; (as the
Poets write of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Morpheus</span></span>) represente such formes
of persones, of places, and other circumstances, as
he pleases to illude them with? Yea, that he maie
deceiue them with the greater efficacie, may hee
not at that same instant, by fellow angelles of his,
illude such other persones so in that same fashion,
whome with he makes them to beleeue that they
mette; that all their reportes and tokens, though
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
seuerallie examined, may euerie one agree with an
other. And that whatsoeuer actiones, either in
hurting men or beasts: or whatsoeuer other thing
that they falselie imagine, at that time to haue
done, may by himselfe or his marrowes, at that
same time be done indeede; so as if they would
giue for a token of their being rauished at the death
of such a person within so shorte space thereafter,
whom they beleeue to haue poysoned, or witched
at that instante, might hee not at that same houre,
haue smitten that same person by the permission
of GOD, to the farther deceiuing of them,
and to mooue others to beleeue them? And this is
surelie the likeliest way, and most according to reason,
which my judgement can finde out in this,
and whatsoeuer vther vnnaturall poyntes of their
confession. And by these meanes shall we saill surelie,
betuixt <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Charybdis</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Scylla</span></span>,
in eschewing the not beleeuing of them altogether on the one part,
least that drawe vs to the errour that there is no
Witches: and on the other parte in beleeuing of it,
make vs to eschew the falling into innumerable
absurdities, both monstruouslie against all Theologie
diuine, and Philosophie humaine.

in the contrarie. And as to the effectes of these two
former partes, to wit, the consultationes and the
outward meanes, they are so wounderfull as I dare
not allege anie of them, without ioyning a sufficient
reason of the possibilitie thereof. For leauing
all the small trifles among wiues, and to speake of
the principall poyntes of their craft. For the common
trifles thereof, they can do without conuerting
well inough by themselues: These principall
poyntes I say are these: They can make men or women
to loue or hate other, which may be verie possible
to the Deuil to effectual, seing he being a subtile
spirite, knowes well inough how to perswade
the corrupted affection of them whom God will
permit him so to deale with: They can lay the siknesse
of one vpon an other, which likewise is verie
possible vnto him: For since by Gods permission,
he layed siknesse vpon <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Iob</span></span>, why may he not farre
easilier lay it vpon any other: For as an old practisian,
he knowes well inough what humor domines
most in anie of vs, and as a spirite hee can subtillie
walken vp the same, making it peccant, or to abounde,
as he thinkes meete for troubling of vs,
when God will so permit him. And for the taking
off of it, no doubt he will be glad to reliue such of
present paine, as he may thinke by these meanes to
perswade to bee catched in his euerlasting snares
and fetters. They can be-witch and take the life of
men or women, by rosting of the Pictures, as I
spake of before, which likewise is verie possible to
their Master to performe, for although, (as I saide
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before) that instrumente of waxe haue no vertue
in that turne doing, yet may hee not verie well
euen by that same measure that his conjured
slaues meltes that waxe at the fire, may he not I say
at these same times, subtilie as a spirite so weaken
and scatter the spirites of life of the patient, as may
make him on th'one part, for faintnesse to sweate
out the humour of his bodie: And on the other
parte, for the not concurrence of these spirites,
which causes his digestion, so debilitat his stomak,
that his humour radicall continually, sweating out
on the one parte, and no new good suck being put
in the place thereof, for lack of digestion on the
other, hee at last shall vanish awaie, euen as his
picture will doe at the fire. And that knauish and
cunning woorkeman, by troubling him onely at
some times, makes a proportion so neare betuixt
the woorking of the one and the other, that both
shall ende as it were at one time. They can rayse
stormes and tempestes in the aire, either vpon Sea
or land, though not vniuersally, but in such a particular
place and prescribed boundes, as God will
permitte them so to trouble: Which likewise is
verie easie to be discerned from anie other naturall
tempestes that are meteores, in respect of the
suddaine and violent raising thereof, together with
the short induring of the same. And this is likewise
verie possible to their master to do, he hauing such
affinitie with the aire as being a spirite, and hauing
such power of the forming and moouing
thereof, as ye haue heard me alreadie declare: For

is giuen vnto him. They can make folkes to becom
phrenticque or Maniacque, which likewise is very
possible to their master to do, sence they are but naturall
sicknesses: and so he may lay on these kindes,
aswell as anie others. They can make spirites either
to follow and trouble persones, or haunt certaine
houses, and affraie oftentimes the inhabitantes: as
hath bene knowen to be done by our Witches at
this time. And likewise they can make some to be
possessed with spirites, &amp; so to becom verie Dæmoniacques:

as by the ones power (though a creature) to admire
the power of the great Creator: by the falshood of
the one to considder the trueth of the other, by the
injustice of the one, to considder the Iustice of the
other: And by the cruelty of the one, to considder
the mercifulnesse of the other: And so foorth in
all the rest of the essence of God, and qualities of
the Deuill. But I feare indeede, there be ouer many
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sadduces</span></span> in this worlde, that denies all kindes of
spirites: For convicting of whose errour, there
is cause inough if there were no more,
that God should permit at sometimes
spirits visiblie to kyith.

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I haue spoken alreadie. The first is, where spirites
troubles some houses or solitarie places: The second,
where spirites followes vpon certaine persones,
and at diuers houres troubles them: The
thirde, when they enter within them and possesse
them: The fourth is these kinde of spirites that are
called vulgarlie the Fayrie. Of the three former
kindes, ye harde alreadie, how they may artificiallie
be made by Witch-craft to trouble folke: Now
it restes to speake of their naturall comming as it
were, and not raysed by Witch-craft. But generally
I must for-warne you of one thing before I enter in
this purpose: that is, that although in my discourseing
of them, I deuyde them in diuers kindes, yee
must notwithstanding there of note my Phrase of
speaking in that: For doubtleslie they are in effect,
but all one kinde of spirites, who for abusing the
more of mankinde, takes on these sundrie shapes,
and vses diuerse formes of out-ward actiones, as if
some were of nature better then other. Nowe I
returne to my purpose: As to the first kinde of these
spirites, that were called by the auncients by diuers
names, according as their actions were. For if they
were spirites that haunted some houses, by appearing
in diuers and horrible formes, and making
greate dinne: they were called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lemures</span></span>
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Spectra</span></span>.
If they appeared in likenesse of anie defunct to
some friends of his, they wer called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vmbræ mortuorum</span></span>:
And so innumerable stiles they got, according
to their actiones, as I haue said alreadie. As we
see by experience, how manie stiles they haue given
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
them in our language in the like maner: Of
the appearing of these spirites, wee are certified

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Iim</span></span>,
which are the proper Hebrewe names for these
Spirites. The cause whie they haunte solitarie
places, it is by reason, that they may affraie and
brangle the more the faith of suche as them alone
hauntes such places. For our nature is such,
as in companies wee are not so soone mooued
to anie such kinde of feare, as being solitare, which
the Deuill knowing well inough, hee will not
therefore assaile vs but when we are weake: And
besides that, GOD will not permit him so to
dishonour the societies and companies of Christians,
as in publicke times and places to walke
visiblie amongst them. On the other parte, when
he troubles certaine houses that are dwelt in, it is a
sure token either of grosse ignorance, or of some
grosse and slanderous sinnes amongst the inhabitantes
thereof: which God by that extraordinarie
rod punishes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epi.</span></span> They will choose the passage for their

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that time. For if they haue assumed a deade bodie,
whereinto they lodge themselues, they can
easely inough open without dinne anie Doore
or Window, and enter in thereat. And if they
enter as a spirite onelie, anie place where the aire
may come in at, is large inough an entrie for them:
For as I said before, a spirite can occupie no quantitie.

when the Witches takes it vp and joyntes it, or
when as Swine wortes vppe the graues? The rest
of them that the Scripture speakes of, is not meaned
by a locall remaining continuallie in one
place, but by their resting from their trauelles
and miseries of this worlde, while their latter conjunction
againe with the soule at that time to receaue
full glorie in both. And that the Deuill may
vse aswell the ministrie of the bodies of the faithfull
in these cases, as of the vn-faithfull, there is
no inconvenient; for his haunting with their bodies
after they are deade, can no-waies defyle
them: In respect of the soules absence. And for
anie dishonour it can be vnto them, by what reason
can it be greater, then the hanging, heading, or many
such shameful deaths, that good men will suffer?
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for there is nothing in the bodies of the faithfull,
more worthie of honour, or freer from corruption
by nature, nor in these of the vnfaithful, while time
they be purged and glorified in the latter daie, as is
dailie seene by the vilde diseases and corruptions,
that the bodies of the faythfull are subject vnto, as

And to that same effect is it, that he now appeares

The next question that I would speere, is likewise
concerning this first of these two kindes
of spirites that ye haue conjoyned: and it is this; ye
knowe how it is commonly written and reported,
that amongst the rest of the sortes of spirites that
followes certaine persons, there is one more monstrous
nor al the rest: in respect as it is alleaged, they
converse naturally with them whom they trouble
and hauntes with: and therefore I would knowe in
two thinges your opinion herein: First if suche a
thing can be: and next if it be: whether there be a
difference of sexes amongst these spirites or not.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epi.</span></span> That abhominable kinde of the Deuils
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
abusing of men or women, was called of old, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Incubi</span></span>
and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Succubi</span></span>, according to the difference of the
sexes that they conuersed with. By two meanes
this great kinde of abuse might possibly be performed:
The one, when the Deuill onelie as a spirite,
and stealing out the sperme of a dead bodie, abuses
them that way, they not graithlie seeing anie
shape or feeling anie thing, but that which he so
conuayes in that part: As we reade of a Monasterie
of Nunnes which were burnt for their being that
way abused. The other meane is when he borrowes
a dead bodie and so visiblie, and as it seemes
vnto them naturallie as a man converses with
them. But it is to be noted, that in whatsoeuer way
he vseth it, that sperme seemes intollerably cold to
the person abused. For if he steale out the nature of
a quick person, it cannot be so quicklie carryed,
but it will both tine the strength and heate by the
way, which it could neuer haue had for lacke of
agitation, which in the time of procreation is the
procurer &amp; wakener vp of these two natural qualities.
And if he occupying the dead bodie as his
lodging expell the same out thereof in the dewe
time, it must likewise be colde by the participation
with the qualities of the dead bodie whereout of
it comes. And whereas yee inquire if these spirites
be diuided in sexes or not, I thinke the rules
of Philosophie may easelie resolue a man of the
contrarie: For it is a sure principle of that arte,
that nothing can be diuided in sexes, except such
liuing bodies as must haue a naturall seede to genere
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by. But we know spirites hath no seede proper
to themselues, nor yet can they gender one
with an other.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phi.</span></span> How is it then that they say sundrie monsters
haue bene gotten by that way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epi.</span></span> These tales are nothing
but <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Aniles fabulæ</span></span>.
For that they haue no nature of their owne, I haue
shewed you alreadie. And that the cold nature of a
dead bodie, can woorke nothing in generation, it
is more nor plaine, as being already dead of it selfe
as well as the rest of the bodie is, wanting the naturall
heate, and such other naturall operation, as is
necessarie for woorking that effect, and incase such
a thing were possible (which were all utterly against
all the rules of nature) it would breed no monster,
but onely such a naturall of-spring, as would haue
cummed betuixt that man or woman and that other
abused person, in-case they both being aliue
had had a doe with other. For the Deuilles parte
therein, is but the naked carrying or expelling of
that substance: And so it coulde not participate
with no qualitie of the same. Indeede, it is possible
to the craft of the Deuill to make a womans bellie
to swel after he hath that way abused her, which he
may do, either by steiring vp her own humor, or by
herbes, as we see beggars daily doe. And when the
time of her deliuery should come to make her thoil
great doloures, like vnto that naturall course, and
then subtillie to slippe in the Mid-wiues handes,
stockes, stones, or some monstruous barne brought
from some other place, but this is more reported

thinges at you concerning the last kinde, I meane
the Dæmoniackes. The first is, whereby shal these

with a natural Phrensie or Manie. The next is, how
can it be that they can be remedied by the Papistes

it should appeare that one Deuil should not cast out
an other, for then would <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">his kingdome be diuided in
it selfe</span></span>, as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> said.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epi.</span></span> As to your first question; there are diuers
symptomes, whereby that heauie trouble may be
discerned from a naturall sickenesse, and speciallie
three, omitting the diuers vaine signes that the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papistes</span></span> attributes vnto it: Such as the raging at holie
water, their fleeing a back from the Croce, their
not abiding the hearing of God named, and innumerable
such like vaine thinges that were alike fashious
and feckles to recite. But to come to these
three symptomes then, whereof I spake, I account
the one of them to be the incredible strength of the
possessed creature, which will farre exceede the
strength of six of the wightest and wodest of any
other men that are not so troubled. The next is the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
boldning vp so far of the patients breast and bellie,
with such an vnnaturall sturring and vehement agitation
within them: And such an ironie hardnes
of his sinnowes so stiffelie bended out, that it were
not possible to prick out as it were the skinne of anie
other person so far: so mightely works the Deuil
in all the members and senses of his body, he being
locallie within the same, suppose of his soule
and affectiones thereof, hee haue no more power
then of any other mans. The last is, the speaking of
sundrie languages, which the patient is knowen by
them that were acquainte with him neuer to haue
learned, and that with an vncouth and hollowe
voice, and al the time of his speaking, a greater motion
being in his breast then in his mouth. But fra
this last symptome is excepted such, as are altogether
in the time of their possessing bereft of al their
senses being possessed with a dumme and blynde
spirite, whereof Christ releiued one, in the 12. of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mathew</span></span>. And as to your next demande, it is first to
be doubted if the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papistes</span></span> or anie not professing the
the onelie true Religion, can relieue anie of that
trouble. And next, in-case they can, vpon what respectes
it is possible vnto them. As to the former vpon
two reasons, it is grounded: first that it is knowen
so manie of them to bee counterfite, which
wyle the Clergie inuentes for confirming of their
rotten Religion. The next is, that by experience
we finde that few, who are possessed indeede, are
fullie cured by them: but rather the Deuill is content
to release the bodelie hurting of them, for a
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
shorte space, thereby to obteine the perpetual hurt
of the soules of so many that by these false miracles
may be induced or confirmed in the profession of
that erroneous Religion: euen as I told you before
that he doth in the false cures, or casting off of diseases
by Witches. As to the other part of the argument
in-case they can, which rather (with reuerence
of the learned thinking otherwaies) I am induced
to beleeue, by reason of the faithfull report
that men sound of religion, haue made according
to their sight thereof, I think if so be, I say these may
be the respectes, whereupon the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papistes</span></span> may haue
that power. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> gaue a commission and power
to his Apostles to cast out Deuilles, which they
according thereunto put in execution: The rules
he bad them obserue in that action, was fasting and
praier: &amp; the action it selfe to be done in his name.
This power of theirs proceeded not then of anie
vertue in them, but onely in him who directed
them. As was clearly proued by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iudas</span></span> his hauing as
greate power in that commission, as anie of the
reste. It is easie then to be vnderstand that the casting
out of Deuilles, is by the vertue of fasting and
prayer, and in-calling of the name of God, suppose
manie imperfectiones be in the person that is
the instrumente,</p><div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 80%; font-style: italic">Mat.</span></span><span style="font-size: 80%"> 7.</span></div></div><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> him selfe teacheth vs
of the power that false Prophets sall haue to caste
out Devils. It is no wounder then, these respects of
this action being considered, that it may be possible
to the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Papistes</span></span>, though erring in sundrie points
of Religion to accomplish this, if they vse the right
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
forme prescribed by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> herein. For what the
worse is that action that they erre in other thinges,
more then their Baptisme is the worse that they
erre in the other Sacrament, and haue eiked many
vaine freittes to the Baptisme it selfe.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phi.</span></span> Surelie it is no little wonder that God
should permit the bodies of anie of the faithfull to

Prophesie by the deuill, yet whome these kinde of

thought to be sonsiest and of best life. To speake of
the many vaine trattles founded vpon that illusion:
How there was a King and Queene of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phairie</span></span>, of

sundry spirites, where we finde the two former, but
diuers names giuen to the Prince of all the rebelling

Prince of all the Deuilles is called, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Beelzebub</span></span> in that
place, which I alleaged against the power of any hereticques
to cast out Deuils. By <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Iohn</span></span> in the Reuelation,
the old tempter is called, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Sathan the Prince of
all the euill angels</span></span>. And the last, to wit, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Lucifer</span></span>, is but
by allegoric taken from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">the day Starre</span></span> (so named in
diuers places of the Scriptures) because of his excellencie
(I meane the Prince of them) in his creation
before his fall. Euen so I say he deceaues the
Witches, by attributing to himselfe diuers names:
as if euery diuers shape that he trans formes himselfe
in, were a diuers kinde of spirit.

that by a far greater reason, such witnesses may be
sufficient in matters of high treason against God:

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phi.</span></span> Indeed, I trow they wil be loath to put any

was dead aswell before that; and
so none coulde slander him with medling in that
vnlawfull arte. For the cause why, as I take it, that
God will not permit Sathan to vse the shapes or similitudes
of any innocent persones at such vnlawful
times, is that God wil not permit that any innocent
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
persons shalbe slandered with that vile defection:
for then the deuil would find waies anew, to
calumniate the best. And this we haue in proofe by
them that are carryed with the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Phairie</span></span>, who neuer
see the shaddowes of any in that courte, but of
them that thereafter are tryed to haue bene brethren
and sisters of that craft. And this was likewise
proued by the confession of a young Lasse, troubled
with spirites, laide on her by Witchcraft. That although
shee saw the shapes of diuerse men &amp; women
troubling her, and naming the persons whom
these shaddowes represents: yet neuer one of them
are found to be innocent, but al clearely tried to be
most guilty, &amp; the most part of them confessing the
same. And besides that, I think it hath ben seldome
harde tell of, that any whome persones guiltie of
that crime accused, as hauing knowen them to be
their marrowes by eye-sight, and not by hear-say,
but such as were so accused of Witch-craft, could
not be clearely tryed vpon them, were at the least
publickly knowen to be of a very euil life &amp; reputation:
so iealous is God I say, of the fame of them
that are innocent in such causes. And besides that;
there are two other good helpes that may be vsed
for their trial: the one is the finding of their marke,
and the trying the insensiblenes thereof. The other
is their fleeting on the water: for as in a secret murther,
if the deade carcase be at any time thereafter
handled by the murtherer, it wil gush out of bloud,
as if the blud wer crying to the heauen for reuenge
of the murtherer, God hauing appoynted that secret
super-naturall signe, for tryall of that secrete
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vnnaturall crime, so it appeares that God hath appoynted
(for a super-naturall signe of the monstruous
impietie of the Witches) that the water shal
refuse to receiue them in her bosom, that haue shaken
off them the sacred Water of Baptisme, and
wilfullie refused the benefite thereof: No not so
much as their eyes are able to shed teares (thretten
and torture them as ye please) while first they repent
(God not permitting them to dissemble their
obstinacie in so horrible a crime) albeit the women
kinde especially, be able other-waies to shed
teares at euery light occasion when they will, yea,
although it were dissemblingly like the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Crocodiles</span></span>.

them vpon a sodaine, hauing neuer doon the like
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

great admiracion, and wondred thereat: by
meanes wherof the saide <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dauid Seaton</span></span> had his
maide in some great suspition, that she did not
those things by naturall and lawfull wayes, but
rather supposed it to be doone by some extraordinary
and vnlawfull meanes.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whervpon, her Maister began to growe very
inquisitiue, and examined her which way and
by what meanes she were able to perfourme
matters of so great importance: whereat she
gaue him no answere, neuerthelesse, her Maister
to the intent that he might the better trye
and finde out the trueth of the same, did with the
helpe of others, torment her with the torture of
the Pilliwinckes vpon her fingers, which is a
greeuous torture, and binding or wrinching her
head with a corde or roape, which is a most cruell
torment also, yet would she not confesse any
thing, whereupon they suspecting that she had
beene marked by the Diuell (as commonly witches
are) made dilligent search about her, and
found the enemies marke to be in her fore crag
or foreparte of her throate: which being found,
she confessed that all her dooings was doone by
the wicked allurements and inticements of the
Diuell, and that she did them by witchcraft.

the elder Witch, was taken and brought to Haliciud
house before the Kings Maiestie and sundry
other of the nobility of Scotland, where she
was straitly examined, but all the perswasions
which the Kings maiestie vsed to her with the rest
of his counsell, might not prouoke or induce her
to confesse any thing, but stood stiffely in the deniall
of all that was laide to her charge: whervpon
they caused her to be conueied awaye to
prison, there to receiue such torture as hath been
lately prouided for witches in that country: and
forasmuch as by due examination of witchcraft
and witches in Scotland, it hath latelye beene
found that the Deuill dooth generallye marke
them with a priuie marke, by reason the Witches
haue confessed themselues, that the Diuell
dooth lick them with his tung in some priuy part
of their bodie, before hee dooth receiue them
to be his seruants, which marke commonly is
giuen them vnder the haire in some part of their
bodye, wherby it may not easily be found out or
scene, although they be searched: and generally
so long as the marke is not seene to those which
search them, so long the parties that hath the

paine most greeuous, which she continued almost
an hower, during which time she would
not confesse any thing vntill the Diuels marke

confessed whatsoeuer was demaunded of

Euen last, she was accompanied aswell with
the persons aforesaide, as also with a great
many other witches, to the number of two hundreth:

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Item, the said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agnis Tompson</span></span> confessed that
the Diuell being then at North Barrick Kerke
attending their comming in the habit or likenes

he at their comming enioyned them all to a pennance,
which was, that they should kisse his
Buttockes, in signe of duetye to him: which being
put ouer the Pulpit barre, euerye one did as

At which time the witches demaunded of the
Diuel why he did beare such hatred to the King,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Item, the saide <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agnis Sampson</span></span> confessed before
the Kings Maiestie sundrye thinges which
were so miraculous and strange, as that his

wherat she answered, she would not wishe his
Maiestie to suppose her woords to be false, but
rather to beleeue them, in that she would discouer
such matter vnto him as his maiestie should
not any way doubt off.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And therupon taking his Maiestie a little aside,
she declared vnto him the verye woordes
which passed betweene the Kings Maiestie and
his Queene at Vpslo in Norway the first night
of their mariage, with their answere eache to other:
whereat the Kinges Maiestie wondered
greatlye, and swore by the liuing God, that he
beleeued that all the Diuels in hell could not
haue discouered the same: acknowledging her
woords to be most true, and therefore gaue the
more credit to the rest which is before declared.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Touching this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agnis Tompson</span></span>, she is the onlye

Kings Maiesties death in this manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
She confessed that she tooke a blacke Toade,
and did hang the same vp by the heeles, three
daies, and collected and gathered the venome as
it dropped and fell from it in an Oister shell, and
kept the same venome close couered, vntill she
should obtaine any parte or peece of foule linnen
cloth, that had appertained to the Kings Maiestie,
as shirt, handkercher, napkin or any other
thing which she practised to obtaine by meanes
of one <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iohn Kers</span></span>, who being attendant in his
Maiesties Chamber, desired him for olde acquaintance
betweene them, to helpe her to one
or a peece of such a cloth as is aforesaide, which
thing the said <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Iohn Kers</span></span> denyed to helpe her too,
saying he could not help her too it.

him to death, and put him to such extraordinary
paines, as if he had beene lying vpon sharp thornes
and endes of Needles.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Moreouer she confessed that at the time when
his Maiestie was in Denmarke, she being accompanied
with the parties before specially named,
tooke a Cat and christened it, and afterward
bound to each parte of that Cat, the cheefest
partes of a dead man, and seuerall ioynts of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his bodie, and that in the night following the
saide Cat was conueied into the midst of the sea
by all these witches sayling in their riddles or
Ciues as is aforesaide, and so left the saide Cat
right before the Towne of Lieth in Scotland:
this doone, there did arise such a tempest in the
Sea, as a greater hath not beene seene: which
tempest was the cause of the perrishing of a
Boate or vessell comming ouer from the towne
of Brunt Iland to the towne of Lieth, wherein
was sundrye Iewelles and riche giftes, which
should haue been presented to the now Queen of
Scotland, at her Maiesties comming to Lieth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Againe it is confessed, that the said christened
Cat was the cause that the Kinges Maiesties
Ship at his comming foorth of Denmarke, had
a contrary winde to the rest of his Ships, then
being in his companye, which thing was most
strange and true, as the Kings Maiestie acknowledgeth,
for when the rest of the Shippes
had a faire and good winde, then was the winde
contrarye and altogither against his Maiestie:
and further the saide witche declared, that his
Maiestie had neuer come safelye from the Sea,
if his faith had not preuailed aboue their ententions.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

how the Diuell would vse them when he
was in their company, they confessed that when
the Diuell did receiue them for his seruants, and
that they had vowed themselues vnto him, then
he would Carnallye vse them, albeit to their little
pleasure, in respect of his colde nature: and
would doo the like at sundry other times.

As touching the aforesaide Doctor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fian, alias
Iohn Cunningham</span></span>, the examination of his actes
since his apprehension, declareth the great subtiltye
of the diuell, and therfore maketh thinges
to appeere the more miraculous: for being apprehended
by the accusation of the saide <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Geillis
Duncane</span></span> aforesaide, who confessed he was their
Regester, and that there was not one man suffered
to come to the Diuels readinges but onlye
he: the saide Doctor was taken and imprisoned,
and vsed with the accustomed paine, prouided
for those offences, inflicted vpon the rest as is aforesaide.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First by thrawing of his head with a roape,
wherat he would confesse nothing.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Secondly, he was perswaded by faire means
to confesse his follies, but that would preuaile
as little.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Lastly he was put to the most seuere and cruell
paine in the world, called the bootes, who after
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he had receiued three strokes, being enquired
if he would confesse his damnable acts and wicked
life, his tung would not serue him to speak,
in respect wherof the rest of the witches willed
to search his tung, vnder which was found two
pinnes thrust vp into the head, whereupon
the witches did laye, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Now is the Charme
stinted</span></span>, and shewed that those charmed Pinnes
were the cause he could not confesse any thing:
then was he immediatly released of the bootes,
brought before the King, his confession was taken,
and his owne hand willingly set ther-vnto,
which contained as followeth.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
First, that at the generall meetinges of those
witches, hee was alwayes preasent: that he
was Clarke to all those that were in subiection
to the Diuels seruice, bearing the name of witches,
that alwaye he did take their othes for
their true seruice to the Diuell, and that he wrot
for them such matters as the Diuell still pleased
to commaund him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Item, he confessed that by his witchcrafte he
did bewitch a Gentleman dwelling neere to the
Saltpans, where the said Doctor kept Schoole,
onely for being enamoured of a Gentlewoman
whome he loued himselfe: by meanes of which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his Sorcerye, witchcraft and diuelish practises,
he caused the said Gentleman that once in xxiiij.
howres he fell into a lunacie and madnes, and so
continued one whole hower together, and for the
veritie of the same, he caused the Gentleman to
be brought before the Kinges Maiestie, which
was vpon the xxiiij. day of December last, and
being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in his Maiesties Chamber, suddenly he gaue a
great scritch and fell into a madnes, sometime
bending himselfe, and sometime capring so directly
vp, that his head did touch the seeling of the
Chamber, to the great admiration of his Maiestie
and others then present: so that all the Gentlemen
in the Chamber were not able to holde
him, vntill they called in more helpe, who together
bound him hand and foot: and suffering the
said gentleman to lye still vntill his furye were
past, he within an hower came againe to himselfe,
when being demaunded of the Kings Maiestie
what he saw or did all that while, answered
that he had been in a sound sleepe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Item the said Doctor did also confesse that he
had vsed means sundry times to obtain his purpose
and wicked intent of the same Gentlewoman,
and seeing himselfe disapointed of his intention,
he determined by all waies he might to
obtaine the same, trusting by coniuring, witchcraft
and Sorcery to obtaine it in this manner.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It happened this gentlewoman being vnmaried,
had a brother who went to schoole with the
said Doctor, and calling his Scholler to him,
demaunded if he did lye with his sister, who answered
he did, by meanes wherof he thought to
obtaine his purpose, and therefore secretlye promised
to teach him without stripes, so he would obtain
for him three haires of his sisters priuities,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at such time as he should spye best occasion for
it: which the youth promised faithfullye to perfourme,
and vowed speedily to put it in practise,
taking a peece of coniured paper of his maister
to lappe them in when he had gotten them: and
therevpon the boye practised nightlye to obtaine
his maisters purpose, especially when his sister
was a sleepe.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But God who knoweth the secrets of all
harts, and reuealeth all wicked and vngodlye
practises, would not suffer the intents of this diuilish
Doctor to come to that purpose which he
supposed it would, and therefore to declare that
he was heauilye offended with his wicked entent,
did so woorke by the Gentlewomans owne
meanes, that in the ende the same was discouered
and brought to light: for she being one night
a sleepe, and her brother in bed with her, suddenlye
cryed out to her mother, declaring that her
Brother would not suffer her to sleepe, wherevpon
her mother hauing a quick capacitie, did vehemently
suspect Doctor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fians</span></span> entention, by reason
she was a witche of her selfe, and therefore
presently arose, and was very inquisitiue of the
boy to vnderstand his intent, and the better to
know the same, did beat him with sundry stripes,
wherby he discouered the trueth vnto her.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Mother therefore being well practised
in witchcrafte, did thinke it most conuenient
to meete with the Doctor in his owne Arte, and
therevpon tooke the paper from the boy, wherein
hee should haue put the same haires, and
went to a young Heyfer which neuer had borne
Calfe nor gone to the Bull, and with a paire of
sheeres, clipped off three haires from the vdder
of the Cow, and wrapt them in the same paper,
which she againe deliuered to the boy, then
willing him to giue the same to his saide Maister,
which he immediatly did.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Schoolemaister so soone as he had receiued
them, thinking them indeede to bee the
Maides haires, went straight and wrought
his arte vpon them: But the Doctor had no sooner
doone his intent to them, but presentlye the
Hayfer or Cow whose haires they were indeed,
came vnto the doore of the Church wherein
the Schoolemaister was, into the which the
Hayfer went, and made towards the Schoolemaister,
leaping and dauncing vpon him, and
following him foorth of the church and to what
place so euer he went, to the great admiration
of all the townes men of Saltpans, and many
other who did beholde the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The reporte whereof made all men imagine
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

whom it could neuer haue beene so sufficientlye
effected: and thervpon, the name of the said Doctor
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fian</span></span> (who was but a very yong man) began
to grow so common among the people of Scotland,
that he was secretlye nominated for a notable

All which although in the beginning he denied,

wayes, acknowledging his most vngodly lyfe,
shewing that he had too much folowed the allurements

him in the night before, appareled all in blacke,
with a white wand in his hande, and that the deuill
demaunded of him if hee would continue his
faithfull seruice, according to his first oath and
promise made to that effect. Whome (as hee then
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg 105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sayd) he vtterly renounced to his face, and sayde
vnto him in this manner, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Auoide Satan, auoide</span></span>,
for I haue listned too much vnto thee, and by the
same thou hast vndone mee, in respect whereof I
vtterly forsake thee. To whome the deuill answered,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">That once ere thou die thou shall bee mine</span></span>. And
with that (as he sayde) the deuill brake the white
wande, and immediatly vanished foorth of his
sight.

Thus all the daie this Doctor Fian continued
verie solitarie, and seemed to haue care of his
owne soule, and would call vppon God, shewing
himselfe penitent for his wicked life, neuerthelesse
the same night hee founde such meanes, that hee
stole the key of the prison doore and chamber in
the which he was, which in the night hee opened
and fled awaie to the Salt pans, where hee was
alwayes resident, and first apprehended. Of
whose sodaine departure when the Kings maiestie
had intelligence, hee presently commanded diligent
inquirie to bee made for his apprehension,
and for the better effecting thereof, hee sent publike
proclamations into all partes of his lande
to the same effect. By meanes of whose hot and
harde pursuite, he was agayn taken and brought
to prison, and then being called before the kings
highnes, hee was reexamined as well touching
his departure, as also touching all that had before
happened.

But this Doctor, notwithstanding that his
owne confession appeareth remaining in recorde
vnder his owne hande writing, and the same
therevnto fixed in the presence of the Kings maiestie
and sundrie of his Councell, yet did hee vtterly
denie the same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Wherevpon the kinges maiestie perceiuing
his stubbourne wilfulnesse, concerned and imagined
that in the time of his absence hee had entered
into newe conference and league with the deuill
his master, and that hee had beene agayne newly
marked, for the which hee was narrowly searched,
but it coulde not in anie wise bee founde, yet
for more tryall of him to make him confesse, hee
was commaunded to haue a most straunge torment
which was done in this manner following.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
His nailes vpon all his fingers were riuen and
pulled off with an instrument called in Scottish
a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Turkas</span></span>, which in England wee call a payre of
pincers, and vnder euerie nayle there was thrust
in two needels ouer euen up to the heads. At all
which tormentes notwithstanding the Doctor
neuer shronke anie whit, neither woulde he then
confesse it the sooner for all the tortures inflicted
vpon him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Then was hee with all conuenient speed, by
commandement, conuaied againe to the torment
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the bootes, wherein hee continued a long
time, and did abide so many blowes in them,
that his legges were crushte and beaten togeather
as small as might bee, and the bones and
flesh so brused, that the bloud and marrowe spouted
forth in great abundance, whereby they were
made unseruiceable for euer. And notwithstanding
al these grieuous paines and cruell torments
hee would not confesse anie thing, so deepely had
the deuill entered into his heart, that hee vtterly
denied all that which he had before auouched,
and woulde saie nothing therevnto but this, that
what hee had done and sayde before, was onely
done and sayde for feare of paynes which he had
endured.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Upon great consideration therefore taken by
the Kings maiestie and his Councell, as well for
the due execution of iustice vppon such detestable
malefactors, as also for example sake, to remayne
a terrour to all others heereafter, that shall attempt
to deale in the lyke wicked and vngodlye
actions, as witchcraft, sorcery, cuniuration, &amp; such
lyke, the sayde Doctor <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Fian</span></span> was soone after araigned,
condemned, and adiudged by the law to die,
and then to bee burned according to the lawe of
that lande, prouided in that behalfe. Wherevpon
hee was put into a carte, and beeing first strangled,
hee was immediatly put into a great fire,
being readie prouided for that purpose, and there
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
burned in the Castle hill of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Edenbrough</span></span> on a saterdaie
in the ende of Ianuarie last past. 1591.
The rest of the witches which are not yet executed,
remayne in prison till farther triall, and
knowledge of his maiesties pleasure.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">This strange discourse before recited, may perhaps
giue some occasion of doubt to such as shall happen to
reade the same, and thereby coniecture that the Kings
maiestie would not hazarde himselfe in the presence
of such notorious witches, least therby might haue insued
great danger to his person and the generall state
of the land, which thing in truth might wel haue bene
feared. But to answer generally to such, let this suffice:
that first it is well knowen that the King is the child &amp;
seruant of God, and they but seruants to the deuil, hee
is the Lords annointed, and they but vesselles of Gods
wrath: he is a true Christian, and trusteth in God, they
worse than Infidels, for they onely trust in the deuill,
who daily serue them, till he haue brought them to vtter
destruction. But heereby it seemeth that his Highnesse
carted a magnanimious and undanted mind, not
feared with their inchantmentes, but resolute in this,
that so long as God is with him, hee feareth not who
is against him. And trulie the whole scope of this treatise
dooth so plainely laie open the wonderfull prouidence
of the Almightie, that if he had not bene defended
by his omnipotencie and power, his Highnes
had neuer returned aliue in his voiage frõ Denmarke,
so that there is no doult but God woulde as well defend
him on the land as on the sea, where they pretended
their damnable practise.</span></span>
